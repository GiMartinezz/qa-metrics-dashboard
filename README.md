# QA Metrics Dashboard (Mocked with Grafana Test Data)

This repository contains a set of QA-related metric queries, visualized through interactive charts built with **Grafana** using the **TestData DB** mock data source.

> Note: The data is simulated for demonstration purposes. The visualizations are based on real queries I used in previous QA projects.

## Why this dashboard?

As a QA professional, I care not only about validating features, but also about building a **clear and objective picture of product quality**. This dashboard reflects that approach by tracking:

-  Bottlenecks in delivery
-  Defects by severity and root cause
-  QA process efficiency

## Included visualizations

### 1. `Average Resolution Time by Issue Type`
**Chart type**: Bar chart  
**Metric**: Average resolution time for *Defects*, *Stories*, and *Story Bugs*  
 [`defect_resolution_time.sql`](queries/defect_resolution_time.sql)  
 ![chart](dashboard/chart_defect_resolution.png)

**Why this chart?**  
It helps identify which issue types take longer to resolve, offering insight into process delays.

---

### 2. `Defects by Severity`
**Chart type**: Pie chart  
**Metric**: Proportion of defects by severity level  
 [`defects_by_severity.sql`](queries/defects_by_severity.sql)  
 ![chart](dashboard/chart_defects_by_severity.png)

**Why this chart?**  
Clearly communicates the impact of reported bugs by highlighting the ratio of critical vs. minor issues.

---

### 3. `QA Efficiency Indicator`
**Chart type**: Gauge or bar  
**Metric**: Ratio of *Story Bugs* to total detected issues  
 [`qa_efficiency.sql`](queries/qa_efficiency.sql)  
 ![chart](dashboard/chart_qa_efficiency.png)

**Why this chart?**  
Helps evaluate how often issues are caught during the story phase versus later, signaling QA effectiveness.

---

### 4. `Story Bugs by Defect`
**Chart type**: Horizontal bar chart or table  
**Metric**: Number of *Story Bugs* associated with each *Defect*  
 [`story_bug_by_defect.sql`](queries/story_bug_by_defect.sql)  
 ![chart](dashboard/chart_story_bug_by_defect.png)

**Why this chart?**  
Highlights recurring bug clusters tied to a single defect, which can point to deeper root causes.

## ðŸ”§ How were they built?

All visualizations were created using:

-  `grafana-testdata-datasource` (mock data)
-  Field transformations and display name overrides in Grafana
-  Hand-picked chart types to best match each metricâ€™s goal
-  Decisions based on my QA experience with real-world products (including blockchain and Web3 projects)
